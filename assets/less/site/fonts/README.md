## How to use

1. Place your font files in this direcotry
2. Define `@font-face` in your overrides file (typically something like `site.overrides.less`)

4. Rebuild the frontend assets (e.g. via `invenio-cli assets build -d`) for changes to appear

## Tips

- Use common formats (woff2, ttf) for good browser support  
- If you're using `invenio-cli assets watch`, you may need to stop/start after adding new font files so changes arenâ€™t missed  
- Keep names consistent and documented so other developers know which fonts are used where
